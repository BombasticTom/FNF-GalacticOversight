# Friday Night Funkin' - Galactic Oversight
A Friday Night Funkin' Mod which uses [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine), an engine originally used on [Mind Games Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/301107), intended to be a fix for the vanilla version's many issues while keeping the casual play aspect of it.
